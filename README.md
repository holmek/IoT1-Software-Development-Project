# IoT1-Software-Development-Project

## Simple overview of use/purpose

The IoT1 Software Development Project introduces a cutting-edge soccer vest equipped with advanced sensors. This vest measures player location, speed, number of tackles, and field angle, providing valuable data for analysis. The project also includes a server where clients can log in to record observations about players on the field. The accompanying 3D model STL file, visualized as Draw.io files, completes the comprehensive solution.

## Description

The IoT1 Soccer Vest is a sports technology designed to enhance the soccer-playing experience. Equipped with sensors, the vest collects data on player location, speed, number of tackles, and field angle. This information is invaluable for performance analysis and strategic insights.

The project also includes a robust server infrastructure that allows clients to log in and record observations about players during matches. This server facilitates collaboration and data sharing among team members and analysts.

To visualize and share the 3D model of the soccer vest, the project provides STL files that can be opened and edited using Draw.io. This allows for customization and further development based on the vest's design.
